###1. Introduction  
The objective of this project is to select a dataset and create an explanatory data visualization using either dimple.js or d3.js., thereafter document the findings.  
I have chosed one of the beginner dataset i.e. "Titanic". Variables available for data analysis include passenger class, name, gender, age, number of siblings/spouses aboard, number of parents/children aboard, ticket number, passenger fare, cabin, port of embarkation and survival indicator.
