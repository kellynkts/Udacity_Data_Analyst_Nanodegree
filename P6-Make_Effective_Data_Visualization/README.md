###1. Summary 

The objective of this project is to select a dataset and create an explanatory data visualization using either dimple.js or d3.js., thereafter document the findings.  

I have chosen one of the beginner dataset i.e. "Titanic". Variables available for data analysis include passenger class, name, gender, age, number of siblings/spouses aboard, number of parents/children aboard, ticket number, passenger fare, cabin, port of embarkation and survival indicator.  

I have created three data visualization for my analysis:  
(a) Number of Survivals by Passenger Class  
(b) Number of Survivals by Age  
(c) Number of Survivals by Passenger Class and Gender
